## Some Programs:

### MultiplyingTables.s

This program generates and displays multiplication tables. It demonstrates the use of loops, arithmetic operations, and output procedures in MIPS assembly language.

### Float.s

This program demonstrates floating-point arithmetic operations in MIPS assembly. It showcases how to handle and perform calculations with floating-point numbers using MIPS instructions.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you will need a MIPS simulator or emulator. One such tool is the [MARS MIPS simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/), which provides an integrated development environment for MIPS assembly language programming.

1. **Download a simulator/emulator**:
   
  a) **Download MARS**: Obtain the latest version of the MARS simulator from the [official website](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/).
  
  b) **Download QtSpim**: Another option that works well is QtSpim, which can be downloaded from the [official website](https://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

2. **Load a Program**: Open MARS and load the desired `.s` file from this repository.

3. **Assemble and Run**: Assemble the program and run it within the simulator to observe its functionality.
